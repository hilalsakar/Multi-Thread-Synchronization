# Thread
 A thread is a sequence of such instructions within a program that can be executed independently of other code.
 I wanted to write thread examples to learn more than I know.

 ## Multi-Thread-Synchronization

 We want to execute same thread with different data more than one times, we must use mutex, semaphore or atomic.
 The easiest way is mutex. So, if you need basic example, you should look my repo!

 ## Thread-And-ReadConfig

 Actually, it's not just thread example.
 I thought that How to write the Multi-Thread-Example without mutex.
 I decided to write immediately. The code is not clear but I understand.
 When I have free time, I will write again.
